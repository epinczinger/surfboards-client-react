# Surfshop Rails - React

On this project, I've developed a Front End application that connects with a [Surfshop API](https://github.com/epinczinger/surfboards-api-rails) that I've also built.
It's a dynamic and fast app since it was built following the best practices of React and Redux.

The application features include:
- A proper authentication where you can Sign In, Sign Up and Sign Out. Your token will also be stored on Local Storage.
- A list of Surfboards and accessories that come from [Surfshop API](https://github.com/epinczinger/surfboards-api-rails).
- After logging in, the User can add items to favourites.
- It's a responsive web, displaying correctly on any screen size from 320px.
- A Redux store from where all states are managed.
